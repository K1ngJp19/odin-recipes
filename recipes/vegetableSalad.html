    <!-- Steps -->
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>To make the dressing: Whisk shallot, red wine vinegar, white balsamic vinegar, garlic, lemon juice, Dijon
            mustard, parsley, chives, cilantro, and dill together in a large bowl. Slowly stream olive oil into the
            mixture while whisking vigorously until the oil is incorporated into a smooth and creamy dressing.</li>
        <li>Arrange asparagus, corn, zucchini, yellow squash, green onions, bell pepper, and red onion onto baking
            sheets. Brush olive oil onto all the vegetables to coat; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook vegetables directly on preheated grill, turning frequently, until slightly charred and just tender,
            about 5 minutes for green onions, 8 minutes for asparagus, zucchini, yellow squash, bell pepper, and red
            onion, and 10 minutes for corn. Remove vegetables to the baking sheets used for preparation and cool.</li>
        <li>Cut asparagus, green onions, zucchini, yellow squash, and red bell pepper crosswise into 1-inch pieces and
            put into a large bowl. Quarter red onion slices; add to bowl. Cut corn kernels from cobs; add to bowl. Let
            vegetables cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Drizzle vinaigrette over the vegetable mixture and toss to coat.</li>
    </ol>
